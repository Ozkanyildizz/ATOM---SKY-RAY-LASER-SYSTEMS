## About
ATOM — Sky Ray Laser Systems is an integrated project that bundles:
- Real-time image processing,
- Laser control (hardware interface and safety-aware control logic),
- A desktop GUI for operators and experiment control,
- Data-prep and YOLOv5 pipelines for object detection workflows.

---

## Repository structure 
This repository contains a few top-level folders used by the projec:  
- `SkyRay Laser Interface` — desktop GUI and main application files.  
- `SkyRay İmage Processing` — image processing and pipelines (label conversion, training helpers).  
- `SkyRay İmages` — example / dataset images and assets.

## Requirements
Recommendations:
- Python 3.11 
- pip
- (Optional) CUDA + compatible PyTorch if you plan to train YOLOv5 on GPU
